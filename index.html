<h1>Arnav</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Arnav. I am in 5th Grade and am 10 years old. I go to Nassakaeg Elemantry which is in Long Island, New York. I like to play tennis, play piano, and code.</p>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>Coding is one of my favorite things to do. I take coding lessons from Whitehat Junior. I have just completed learning how to code apps. Some of the most recent apps I have coded are the Chat App and the Two Player Tic Tac Toe. Now I am learning how to code webpages.</p>
    <h3>My First Webpage</h3>
    <p>This is my first webpage. I am coding this using an IDE. I am learning index.html and more!</p>
